Happy customer:

In this project, I used random forest and XGBoost for classification. The RF model gives an accuracy of 0.615, and the most important features are X2: contents of my order was as I expected , X5: I am satisfied with my courier, and X3: I ordered everything I wanted to order. I then proceed to refine the accuracy with XGBoost, which gives an accuracy of 0.769. The trained model of XGBoost is saved in model/, the feature importance plot is saved in plot/, and a notebook walking through all steps is saved in notebook/
